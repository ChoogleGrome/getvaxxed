                The beginning of vaccination started in 18th century when a vaccination against smallpox was invented in 1796 by Edward Jenner. It was developed after Edward noticed that milkmaids seemed to be immune to smallpox when they had caught cowpox. After some testing Edward did on his family, he released the vaccination. The vaccination at the time proved to be crucial in protecting against Smallpox, and was seen as a huge victory against smallpox. However for many people the idea of injecting hormones from cows into the human body seemed a little discomforting and disgusting at first. This lead to the start of the Anti Vax movement.

                The early Anti Vax movement was huge. Vaccination rates in the 1800’s were staggering low and caused a lot of debate among people. Vaccination faced many different forms of objections from religious to scientific to sanitary and since the idea seemed rather absurd, most people started to believe in them. However as the rate at which Smallpox spread increased and more and more people were starting to get Smallpox, they looked to vaccination as an answer. An answer which could solve this problem. Over the years, vaccination rates increase heavily. This was linked with more people taking vaccination and there being more evidence suggesting the effectiveness of vaccines. After the importance of vaccinations was recognised by the government the Vaccination act of 1853 was created. The act ordered mandatory vaccination for infants up to 3 months old. (This was slowly extended to 14 years in the next Act of 1867). During the time of the Act being active, countries saw a huge decrease in smallpox numbers almost getting to a point where these diseases were forgotten.

                The Anti Vax movement from there continued to strive but in lower population as more and more diseases were being tackled with the help of vaccinations. The movement had major outbreaks in the mid-1900s in UK which attempted to prove that while vaccines solved on problem, it created other complications such as DTP immunisation. These case studies proved huge for the anti vax community as the case was the centre of all television shows and documentaries created at the time. This affected both United Kingdom and United States hugely as the decline in vaccination rates lead to the increase of rather preventable diseases. However as the Government took action and slowly these case studies and documentaries were proved wrong, vaccination rates were on the rise again.

                It wasn’t until the late 1990’s that another major outbreak occurred when a study suggested that the use of vaccination was directly linked to children having autism. The study looked at the rate at which children had autism and noticed the rate getting much higher through history. This outbreak caused huge public debate and became the number one reason for people choosing to not vaccinate their children.

                From then to now, there have been many studies proving that vaccines has been linked to xyz disease but the evidence that went along with the study was not strong enough. Year after year, these studies were proved to be fraud worthy and unreliable but people continued to believe in the harmful effects of vaccination. Currently vaccines are optional and are dependent or whether or not the parent wishes to vaccinate their children or not.

                Whether or not these case studies linking vaccines to harmful diseases and side effects were real or not, no one knows for sure but there is no denying the fact that vaccines have saved billions of lives through preventing rather dangerous diseases which otherwise without vaccines would have been the leading factor for millions if not billions of death yearly.
