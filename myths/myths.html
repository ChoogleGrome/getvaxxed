                Fears over the safety of vaccines are understandable. The CDC recommends that children should receive up to 14 shots by the age of six, with many of the vaccines developed in the last 20 years. Many parents distrust these vaccines, they are worried about the potential risks and long-term side effects. Research has shown that the biggest fears about vaccines have no proof.

                One of the most common myth about vaccines is that they cause autism. There is actually no proof that this is happening or even possible. Doctors are still trying to figure out why and how children develop autism. Regardless, the speculation was paid attention to, and a few other real investigations were led. None of them found a connection between any immunisation and the probability of creating autism. Today, the genuine reasons for autism remain a secret. A few examinations have now recognised side effects of autism in children a long time before they get the MMR immunisation.

                There is a myth going around that if you do not get vaccinated that only you have to bare the consequences. This simply is not the truth. Herd immunity makes it difficult to spread diseases but not impossible. There must be a certain amount of people for herd immunity to be effective. Some recent outbreaks have shown that if a population does not have above a certain amount of vaccinated people that a disease will spread easily. An easy way to think about it is like this. Let’s say you had 100 glasses filled with clear liquid. 99 of those glasses are filled with plain tap water. The remaining glass is filled with hydrogen peroxide, which is a clear, odourless liquid that if consumed will kill you. The hydrogen peroxide will act as our infected individual. Now if you were forced to pick a glass and drink from it, it is safe to say that you will most likely live. Now let’s say that only 60 glasses are filled with water and the other 40 are filled with hydrogen peroxide. Your chances of picking the wrong glass have suddenly skyrocketed.

                To put this as simply as possible, vaccines are extremely effective. Now this does depend on the vaccine but 95 to 100 percent of people will develop immunity to the disease that has been targeted. There have been countless scientific journals published that prove that vaccines are indeed effective, and you can find them with a simple google search. You can even go to the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/) and find studies that prove the effectiveness. The most convincing proof however would be history itself. Between 1958 and 1962 there was over 500 000 reported cases of measles and over 400 confirmed deaths. With the introduction the measles vaccine in 1963 there was only 89 reported cases with 0 deaths.
